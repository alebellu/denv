Yet another manager for Docker based environments. See [why another one](https://github.com/ssouporg/denv/wiki/Rational).

Denv offers:

- A server daemon which talks to a Docker engine to manage environments
- A way to store the configuration of environments, their versions, and some info about running environments
- A [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/ssouporg/denv/wiki/CLI-Commands)
- A [REST API](https://github.com/ssouporg/denv/wiki/REST-API)
- A Java Client library for easier interaction with the REST API
- A Web Console (planned)
